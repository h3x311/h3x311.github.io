I think the most difficult part of English learning is the sentence connection, such as the video that uses friends to teach the common connections for words. Up and down is also important part. And the American accent, some alphat is not same as chinese, I need to learn by the youtube.

The connection is hard to visualize, when you learn the new words, the count of this can make sense, but it's hard in speaking, practice, listening, and it takes long time to show the effect.

And now the weakness in my side, it's speaking.
So I choose the interesting/simple/lifestyle videos in youtube to listen.
Read the easy blog and articles.
I use the youtube video such as friends teaching to learn the words connections in sentence.
