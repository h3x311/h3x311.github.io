I think the most difficult part of English learning is the sentence connection, such as the video that uses friends to teach the common connections for words. Up and down is also an important part. And the American accent, some alphat is not the same as chinese, which I need to learn by the youtube.

The connection is hard to visualize, when you learn new words, the count of this may make sense, but it's hard in speaking, practice, listening, and it takes long time to show the effect.

And now my side's weakness is speaking.
So I select the interesting/simple/lifestyle videos from youtube to listen.
Read the easy blog and articles.
I watch the youtube video such as friends teaching to learn the words connections in sentence.
